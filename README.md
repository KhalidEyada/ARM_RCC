STM32F401 RCC Driver
STM32F401RE

Overview
The STM32F401 RCC Driver is a comprehensive library that provides a user-friendly interface for configuring and controlling the Reset and Clock Control (RCC) peripheral in the STM32F401RE microcontroller. The RCC peripheral is responsible for setting up and managing the clock system, including clock sources, PLL configuration, and various clock prescalers. By using this driver, developers can easily configure the clock system for their applications and enable/disable clocks for specific peripherals as needed.

Key Features
Clock Configuration: The driver allows developers to configure the clock system using various clock sources, such as the High-Speed Internal (HSI) oscillator, High-Speed External (HSE) oscillator, and the Phase-Locked Loop (PLL).

Peripheral Clock Control: Easily enable or disable the clock for specific peripherals to optimize power consumption and improve overall system performance.

Clock Output (MCO): The driver supports the configuration of the MCO (Microcontroller Clock Output) pin to output the system clock to external devices for debugging or synchronization purposes.

Error Handling: Comprehensive error handling is integrated into the driver to detect and report issues related to clock configuration.

Sample Applications: The library includes well-documented sample applications that demonstrate different clock configuration scenarios and usage patterns.

Installation
To use the STM32F401 RCC Driver in your STM32F401RE project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository or download the source code.
Copy the relevant driver files (rcc.c and rcc.h) into your project directory.
Include the rcc.h header file in your application code.
Usage
Using the STM32F401 RCC Driver is straightforward:

Initialize the RCC: Call the initialization function to set up the clock system and configure clock sources, PLL, and other parameters.

Enable/Disable Peripherals: Use the provided functions to enable or disable the clock for specific peripherals that your application requires.

Output Clock (Optional): If needed, configure the MCO pin to output the system clock to external devices for debugging or synchronization.
